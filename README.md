### Advanced Configuration

You can include additional settings in `matterbridge-tado-hw.config.json` to customise the behaviour or enable special debug features:

| Key                     | Default            | Description
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ---
| `name`<br>`type`<br>`version` | n/a          | These are managed by Matterbridge and do not need to be set manually.
| `pollInterval`          | 1200               | Specifies the interval in seconds between polling the tado° API for the hot water zone status.
| `blackList`             | `[]`               | If the list is not empty, then any hot water control devices with matching serial numbers will not be exposed as Matter devices.
| `whiteList`             | `[]`               | If the list is not empty, then only hot water control devices with matching serial numbers (and not on the `blacklist`) will be exposed as Matter devices.
| `debug`                 | `false`            | Sets the logger level for this plugin to *Debug*, overriding the global Matterbridge logger level setting.
| `unregisterOnShutdown`  | `false`            | Unregister all exposed devices on shutdown. This is used during development and testing; do not set it for normal use.

Tado° apply daily usage limits to third-party use of their REST API. The default value for `pollInterval` issues one request per hot water controller every 20 minutes, resulting in 72 requests/day. Users with active Auto-Assist subscriptions may prefer to use a shorter interval.

| Auto-Assist Subscription | Requests/Day |
| :----------------------: | -----------: |
| ❌                        | 100          |
| ✅                        | 20,000       |

## Functionality

The plugin exposes hot water control of tado° V2/V3/V3+ Extension Kit (BU01) or Wireless Receiver (EK01) units as Matter On/Off Switches. Other functionality is natively exposed to HomeKit by the tado° devices, so is not duplicated by this plugin.

Tado° X is not supported.
