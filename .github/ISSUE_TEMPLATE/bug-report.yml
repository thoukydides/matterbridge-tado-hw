        Provide relevant Matterbridge logs, either pasted below or attached as a text file. Do NOT use a screenshot. Replace sensitive information (access tokens, etc) with `REDACTED`. Logs are most useful when they are complete; include the full output around the error message and do not omit any lines.

        Enable and capture appropriate extra debug:
        
        - **For Plugin Debug Logging** (enable for most issues):
          - In Matterbridge frontend: *Home* > *Plugins* > *matterbridge-tado-hw* > ‚öôÔ∏è > *debug* > ‚úÖ
            - Or in the `matterbridge-tado-hw.config.json` file: `"debug": true`
          - View the log file directly (e.g. `journalctl -u matterbridge.service -n 1000 -f --output cat`); the Matterbridge frontend normally filters out debug messages.
          
        - **For Matterbridge Logging**:
          - In Matterbridge frontend: *Settings* > *Matterbridge settings* > *Logger level* > *Debug*.
            - Or add `-logger debug` to the `matterbridge` command line.
          
        - **For Matter Logging**:
          - In Matterbridge frontend: *Settings* > *Matter settings* > *Logger level* > *Debug*.
            - Or add `-matterlogger debug` to the `matterbridge` command line.
        
        The additional debug information in the logs will provide more context for resolving your issue.
