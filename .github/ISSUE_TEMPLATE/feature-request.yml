        Before creating a new feature request, please search [closed/rejected issues](https://github.com/thoukydides/matterbridge-tado-hw/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to avoid duplicates.

        ðŸš¨ Feature requests that propose any of the following are unlikely to be accepted:
        - Disabling or suppressing existing functionality via additional configuration options
        - Using Matter clusters in ways that violate CSA specifications
        - Implementing Matter clusters that are not supported by Apple Home
        - Duplicating functionality that tadoÂ° already exposes to HomeKit natively

        Describe the feature or improvement you would like to see. 
        Be specific: What problem does it solve? How would a user experience it differently?

        Suggest how this feature could be supported using [node-tado-client](https://mattdavis90.github.io/node-tado-client/), or the underlying tadoÂ° API.

      label: Matter Mapping
      description: |
        Suggest which Matter cluster(s) from the [Matter Application Cluster Specification](https://csa-iot.org/developer-resource/specifications-download-request/) might apply.

        Note: Apple Home only supports a subset of Matter clusters. The most accurate (though incomplete) information is available in [this Apple support article](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102135). It does not yet reflect recent additions such as robot vacuum (added in iOS 18.4).

        If the requested feature maps to a Matter cluster that is unsupported by Apple Home it is unlikely to be implemented, even if technically valid within Matter.

        **Important notes:**
        - Feature requests must be compatible with both the Matter specification and the TadoÂ° API.
        - Requests that fall outside the scope of either are unlikely to be implemented.
        - Functionality that is incompatible with Apple Home, or duplicates existing HomeKit exposure, will be rejected.
        - Detailed, actionable suggestions with clear technical rationale are far more likely to be considered.
